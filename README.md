**მოგესალმებით Password Generator-ის დავალებაზე, გილოცავთ აქ მოხვედრას და წარმატებებს გისურვებთ.**<br />

## Description: <p>You have 2 hours to create a simple React or Next.js web application that integrates with an existing Node.js project for password generation. The Node.js project provides symbols for password generation, and your task is to create a basic user interface for generating passwords using this Node.js API.</p>

## Tasks:

### Project Setup:
Create a new React or Next.js project.
Set up the basic folder structure for components.

### Integration with Node.js API:
Make a GET request to the existing Node.js project's endpoint that provides password generation functionality.
Ensure that you can successfully fetch data (symbols) from the Node.js API.

### User Interface (UI):
Create a minimal UI with an input field for specifying password length.
Include a button for generating passwords.

## Password Generation Logic:
Implement the password generation logic by sending the user's criteria (password length) to the Node.js API and receiving the generated password.

### Display Generated Password:
Display the generated password on the UI.

In this simplified version of the assignment, participants will focus solely on integrating the Node.js API, implementing password generation, and creating a basic UI. Additional features, styling, testing, and documentation have been removed to meet the 2-hour deadline. Be sure to communicate the adjusted expectations and encourage participants to prioritize completing the core tasks within the given time frame.
